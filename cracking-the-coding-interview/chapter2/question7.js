Given two (singly) linked lists, determine if the two lists intersect. Return
the intersecting node. Note that the intersection is defined based on reference,
not value. That is, if the kth node of the first linked list is the exact same
node (by reference) as the jth node of the second linked list, then they are
intersecting.

/*
In this method, we find the difference (D) between the count of nodes in both 
the lists. Then, we increment the start pointer of the longer list by D nodes. 
Now, we have both start pointers at the same distance from the intersection 
point, so we can keep incrementing both the start pointers until we find the 
intersection point.

Get the count of the nodes in the first list, let the count be c1.
Get the count of the nodes in the second list, let the count be c2.
Get the difference of counts d = abs(c1 â€“ c2)
Now traverse the bigger list from the first node to d nodes so that 
from here onwards both the lists have an equal no of nodes
Then we can traverse both lists in parallel till we come across a 
common node. (Note that getting a common node is done by comparing the address of the nodes)

NOTE: This uses the node data, althought the question states not to.
Time complexity: O(m+n);
Auxiliary space: O(1);
